feat: Add automated security scanning and vulnerability detection

Add comprehensive security scanning infrastructure including dependency
vulnerability scanning, code security analysis, and secrets detection to
enhance enterprise security posture.

Security Scanning Infrastructure:
- Add .github/workflows/security-scan.yml for automated security scanning
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning with safety and pip-audit
  - Code security scanning with bandit
  - Weekly scheduled scans (Mondays at 00:00 UTC)
  - Artifact uploads for security reports
  - Runs on push, pull requests, and scheduled basis
- Add .gitleaks.toml for secrets detection
  - Custom rules for ARKHE-specific API keys
  - Generic secret patterns (passwords, tokens, keys)
  - AWS credentials detection
  - Private key detection
  - Allowlist for test files and documentation

Security Documentation:
- Add docs/guides/security_best_practices.md with comprehensive security guide
  - Dependency security and vulnerability scanning procedures
  - Secrets management best practices (environment variables, .env files, production secrets)
  - Code security guidelines (input validation, SQL injection prevention, path traversal)
  - Security scanning tools usage and examples
  - Vulnerability reporting process
  - Security checklist for production deployments

Development Dependencies:
- Update requirements-dev.txt with security scanning tools
  - safety>=2.3.0 for dependency vulnerability scanning
  - pip-audit>=2.6.0 for dependency vulnerability auditing
  - bandit[toml]>=1.7.5 for code security scanning

Files Added:
- .github/workflows/security-scan.yml
- .gitleaks.toml
- docs/guides/security_best_practices.md

Files Modified:
- requirements-dev.txt

This commit enhances the project's security posture by providing:
- Automated vulnerability detection in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependency security monitoring
- Code security analysis
- Secrets detection and prevention
- Comprehensive security documentation and best practices

Related to enterprise infrastructure improvements and addresses
dependency management security gaps from enterprise analysis.
