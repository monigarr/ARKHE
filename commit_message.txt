feat: Add code quality tools and health monitoring system

Add comprehensive code quality enforcement and production-ready health
monitoring capabilities to improve enterprise readiness.

Code Quality Tools:
- Add .flake8 configuration for code style enforcement
  - Max line length: 100 characters
  - Black-compatible ignores (E203, E501, W503)
  - Per-file ignores for __init__.py and tests
  - Complexity checking enabled
- Add mypy.ini for static type checking
  - Python 3.10+ support
  - Platform-specific settings (Windows/Linux)
  - Module-specific ignores for external dependencies
  - Gradual strict mode settings
- Enhanced .pre-commit-config.yaml integration with flake8

Health Monitoring System:
- Add src/math_research/utils/health.py with HealthChecker class
  - PyTorch/CUDA availability and version checks
  - NumPy and Pandas version verification
  - Filesystem access validation for critical directories
  - Module import verification for core components
  - System resource monitoring (memory, disk usage)
  - Comprehensive health status reporting
- Add convenience functions: get_health_status(), is_healthy()
- Export health utilities in src/math_research/utils/__init__.py

Streamlit Integration:
- Add "🏥 Health Check" page to Streamlit dashboard
  - Real-time health status monitoring
  - Detailed diagnostics for each component
  - Visual status indicators (✅/❌)
  - Expandable sections for each check category
  - JSON export functionality
  - Refresh button for manual updates
- Import HealthChecker in Streamlit app for diagnostics

Documentation:
- Update CHANGELOG.md with version 0.1.2
  - Document code quality tools addition
  - Document health monitoring system
  - Include Streamlit health check page
- Update README.md
  - Add health monitoring to Streamlit dashboard features
  - Update page count from 5 to 6 pages
  - Add health monitoring to enterprise quality section

Files Added:
- .flake8
- mypy.ini
- src/math_research/utils/health.py

Files Modified:
- src/math_research/utils/__init__.py
- src/apps/streamlit_demo/app.py
- CHANGELOG.md
- README.md

This commit enhances the project's enterprise readiness by providing:
- Automated code quality enforcement
- Production monitoring capabilities
