fix: Correct duration check in RequestLogger.log_response

Fix bug where duration=0.0 (valid measurement for fast operations) was
incorrectly treated as falsy, causing duration to be omitted from log messages.

The original code used `if duration` which evaluates to False when
duration=0.0, preventing valid zero-duration measurements from being
logged. Changed to `if duration is not None` to correctly distinguish
between "duration provided" (including 0.0) and "duration omitted" (None).

Changes:
- Replace ternary expression with explicit if/else for clarity
- Change condition from `if duration` to `if duration is not None`
- Ensure duration=0.0 is correctly included in log messages
- Maintain backward compatibility (duration=None still omits timing)

Files Modified:
- src/math_research/utils/observability.py

This fix ensures that all valid duration measurements, including zero-
duration operations, are properly logged with timing information.
