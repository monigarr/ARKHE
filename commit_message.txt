feat: Add enterprise infrastructure components

Add security policy, containerization, and CI/CD configuration to improve
enterprise readiness and deployment capabilities.

Security:
- Add SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting process
- Define security contact and response time commitments
- Include security best practices and known considerations

Containerization:
- Add multi-stage Dockerfile with 6 build targets (production, dev, streamlit, cuda)
- Add docker-compose.yml with service profiles for different use cases
- Add .dockerignore to optimize build context
- Add comprehensive Docker setup guide in docs/guides/docker_setup.md

Infrastructure:
- Add .github/workflows for CI/CD automation
- Add .gitignore and .dockerignore for proper file exclusions
- Add .pre-commit-config.yaml for code quality checks

Features:
- Production-ready Docker images with non-root user
- GPU/CUDA support for ML workloads
- Streamlit web interface containerization
- Development environment with hot-reload support
- Profile-based service selection in docker-compose

This commit addresses enterprise readiness gaps identified in the project
analysis and provides standardized deployment options.
